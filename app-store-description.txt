Make any website your desktop wallpaper.

This enables you to have a highly dynamic desktop wallpaper. You could display your favorite news site, Facebook feed, or a random beautiful scenery photo. The use-cases are limitless. You could even set an animated GIF as wallpaper.

You can specify the opacity and reload interval in the preferences.


# Example use-cases

- Show a random puppy image
	Example URL: https://source.unsplash.com/random/2880x1756?puppy
	Replace the numbers with your screen resolution. Subtract 44 (or 22 for non-retina) on the height to account for the menu bar.
- Calendar
- Personal stats


# Tip

You can interact with the website by enabling “Browsing Mode”. When in this mode, you can right-click to be able to go back/forward, reload, and zoom in the page contents. You can also pinch to magnify. This is different from zooming the page contents in that it will zoom in to a specific part of the page instead of just enlarging everything.
