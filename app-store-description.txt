■ Tips

‣ Browsing mode

You can interact with the website by enabling “Browsing Mode”. When in this mode, you can right-click to be able to go back/forward, reload, and zoom in the page contents (the zoom level is saved). You can also pinch to magnify. This is different from zooming the page contents in that it will zoom in to a specific part of the page instead of just enlarging everything.

Plash injects a CSS class named “plash-is-browsing-mode” on the “html” element while browsing mode is active. You could use this class to customize the website for browsing mode.

If clicking a link opens it in a new window, you can hold the Option key while clicking the link to open it in the main Plash window.

‣ Zoom in website

To zoom in the website, activate “Browsing Mode”, right-click the website, and then select “Zoom In”.

‣ URL placeholders for screen width and height

Use `[[screenWidth]]` and `[[screenHeight]]` in any URL and Plash will substitute the right values for you. For example, `https://source.unsplash.com/random/[[screenWidth]]x[[screenHeight]]?puppy`.
